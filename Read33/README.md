# Authentication & Production Server

## JWT

### What is JSON Web Token

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard, that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

### When should you use JSON Web Tokens?

Here are some scenarios where JSON Web Tokens are useful:

**Authorization**: This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different domains.

**Information Exchange**: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using public/private key pairs—you can be sure the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.

### What is the JSON Web Token structure?

In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:

- Header
- Payload
- Signature
Therefore, a JWT typically looks like the following.

```
xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz
```

## A Production Stack 

You want to only use tech in production, which is reliable, well tested and has been around for a while.

A production setup usually consists of multiple components, each designed and built to be really good at one specific thing. They are fast, reliable and very focused.

When a request arrives at your server, it should be passed to a dedicated web server. Nginx is an example for a good web server.

This is an application, which is great at serving static files from disk (your css and js files for example) and handling multiple requests at once. If the request is not for a static file, but should be processed by your application, the webserver is configured to pass this request to the next component.

The next component is an application server. It gets those fancy requests and uses them to construct Python objects which are usable by Django.

### How Does Django Fit In?

Your Django app does not actually run as you would think a server would - waiting for requests and reacting to them. Your project provides a uwsgi.py file, which contains a function to be called by the application server. This function gets a Python object representing the incoming request.

This function calls your code, and produces a response object which is passed to the WSGI server. There the response is translated into a HTTP response and is passed back to the web server, which finally delivers it to the user.
