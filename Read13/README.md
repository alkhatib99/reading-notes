## Linear Regression in Python

### Regression

Regression analysis is one of the most important fields in statistics and machine learning. 
<br>
find a function that maps some features or variables to others sufficiently well.
The dependent features are called the dependent variables, outputs, or responses.
<br>
The independent features are called the independent variables, inputs, or predictors.

### When Do You Need Regression?

you need regression to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related. 
<br>
Regression is also useful when you want to forecast a response using a new set of predictors. 

#### Linear Regression

Linear regression is probably one of the most important and widely used regression techniques.

#### Problem Formulation

#### Regression Performance
The coefficient of determination, denoted as πΒ², tells you which amount of variation in π¦ can be explained by the dependence on π± using the particular regression model. 
<br>
The value πΒ² = 1 corresponds to SSR = 0, that is to the perfect fit since the values of predicted and actual responses fit completely to each other.
#### Underfitting and Overfitting
* Underfitting occurs when a model canβt accurately capture the dependencies among data, usually as a consequence of its own simplicity. 
<br>
* Overfitting happens when a model learns both dependencies among data and random fluctuations

#### How to Run Linear Regression in Python

Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction. Today, I will explore the sklearn.linear_model module which contains βmethods intended for regression in which the target value is expected to be a linear combination of the input variablesβ.

```Python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sklearn
```

Linear regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis. The overall idea of regression is to examine two things: (1) does a set of predictor variables do a good job in predicting an outcome (dependent) variable? (2) Which variables in particular are significant predictors of the outcome variable, and in what way do theyβindicated by the magnitude and sign of the beta estimatesβimpact the outcome variable? These regression estimates are used to explain the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
