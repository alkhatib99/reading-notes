# class_17 - Web Scraping

## Web Scraping

Web scraping is a technique to automatically access and extracts large amounts of information from a website, which can save a huge amount of time and effort.

### Important notes about web scraping

 1- Read through the websiteâ€™s Terms and Conditions to understand how you can legally use the data. Most sites prohibit you from using the data for commercial purposes.
 2- Make sure you are not downloading data at too rapid a rate because this may break the website. You may potentially be blocked from the site as well.

### Inspecting the Website

The first thing that we need to do is to figure out where we can locate the links to the files we want to download inside the multiple levels of HTML tags.

### Python Code

library :

* import requests
* import urllib.request
* import time
* from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

Last but not least, we should include this line of code so that we can pause our code for a second so that we are not spamming the website with requests. This helps us avoid getting flagged as a spammer.
